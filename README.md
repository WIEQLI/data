# data

The purpose of this repository is to provide links to open geophysical data sets, capture meta-data and provide examples of how to load the data. 

All submitted data sets should be archived elsewhere so that they have a DOI, for example using: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) or [Dryad](http://datadryad.org/).
